CriminalCaseBot
===============

A silly "trainable" bot for the Criminal Case facebook game


It works by continiusly taking desktop screenshots, locating an anchor pixel (not always perfectly, 
if stuck scroll the page :p) trying to match the names via their size, some pixels and their md5 hash,
and if its a known item it clicks on its position.


This is some very ugly code that got hacked together very fast, so plrease, for your eyes, don't read it :)

It's writen in C# and VS 2k10, might work with the express edition as well
